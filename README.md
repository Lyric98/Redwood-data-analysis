# Redwood-data-analysis


The macroscope allows us to collect a large amount of data that have the potential to advance the state of science by enabling dense temporal and spatial monitoring of large volumes. The purpose of this paper is to explore microclimate around a redwood tree by using wireless sensor network. To do this, author and his teammate attached nodes with wireless sensor network around a Redwood tree. Each node measured air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active solar radiation. This wireless network captured a detailed picture of the complex spatial variation and temporal dynamics of the microclimate surrounding a redwood tree. Further, this study possibly can be used to validate other biological theories and study.
